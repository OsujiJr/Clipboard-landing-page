## My process

## Introduction
Provide a brief introduction to your project.

## Development Process

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
I followed a mobile-first approach to design and develop this project. Mobile-first means that I initially designed and styled the project for mobile devices before making it responsive for larger screens using media queries.

#### Mobile Styles
- I began by creating the HTML structure of the project, focusing on a simple and responsive layout that works well on mobile devices.
- The CSS styles I applied at this stage were optimized for small screens, with a focus on readability and usability on mobile phones and smaller tablets.
- I used flexible units like percentages and `rem` for font sizes to ensure content adapts well to different screen sizes.

#### Media Queries for Larger Screens
- After establishing a solid mobile design, I implemented media queries to enhance the project's appearance and usability on larger screens.
- I targeted specific breakpoints where I adjusted the layout, typography, and spacing to make the project more visually appealing and user-friendly on tablets and desktops.
- Media queries were used to ensure a seamless transition between different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience for all users.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
 While I have successfully used flexboxes and grids in this project, I acknowledge that there is always room for improvement. Here are some areas where I plan to further enhance my skills.
